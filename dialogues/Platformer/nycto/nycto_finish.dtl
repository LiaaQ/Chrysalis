Companion: You did it!
Companion: Darkness doesn't necessarily have to mean danger.
Companion: Our head sees danger... even when there isn’t any.
Companion: But you kept going. You sat with the fear.
Companion: And look — the shadows didn’t swallow you.
Companion: They just… passed.

Chrysalis: So that’s it? Just wait it out?
- That still feels terrifying.
- I didn’t really “win,” though.
	Companion: It's not about winning. It's about not running.
- I thought something would jump out at any moment.

Companion: You showed up. You stayed. That’s enough.
Companion: Fear can be loud, but it doesn't always mean stop.
Companion: And hey... next time it feels too dark?
Companion: Just remember what you did here.
Companion: You lit a path by walking it.
