Stranger: Wait! …don’t hurt me.

Chrysalis: …You were the one watching me and attacking me.

Stranger: I—I was just trying to keep people away. That’s all.
Chrysalis: So you were hiding too?
Stranger: Yeah. Turns out being scary is a good way to stay alone.
- That’s… kind of familiar.
Chrysalis: That’s… kind of familiar.
Stranger: You get it, then. Being seen feels like being held under a microscope.
Stranger: Funny thing is… you kept going anyway. Even when I tried to scare you off.

- I thought you hated me.
	Chrysalis: I thought you hated me.
	Stranger: No. I was just scared you’d hate me first.
- I was sure you were judging me.
	Chrysalis: I was sure you were judging me.
	Stranger: Honestly? I was scared that you would judge me.
- I felt like everyone was watching me…
	Chrysalis: I felt like everyone was watching me…
	Stranger: …Yeah. Me too.

Chrysalis: So… you were scared. And I was scared.
Chrysalis: And we both thought we were the only one.
Stranger: Kinda stupid, huh?

- Not stupid. Just human.
	Chrysalis: Not stupid. Just human.
- Makes sense, in a weird way.
	Chrysalis: Makes sense, in a weird way.
- I think… maybe everyone feels like that sometimes.
	Chrysalis: I think… maybe everyone feels like that sometimes.

Stranger: Maybe next time someone stares too long… it’s not hate. It’s just fear.

Chrysalis: Or maybe they’re just awkward. Like me. Like you.

Stranger: Guess that means we’re not so different after all.

Chrysalis: Maybe we'll meet in real life sometime.

Stranger: And it will go better than last time.
