Companion: Hey.
Companion: You're still here.
- Was this all... real?
	Companion: Real enough to feel it.
	Companion: Real enough to leave something behind.
- Did I actually help anyone?
	Companion: You didn’t fix anyone.
	Companion: You saw them and helped them understand themselves.
	Companion: That was enough.
- I don’t know what to do now.
	Companion: You don’t have to know.
	Companion: Just keep going with the flow.

Companion: You helped people see their shadows.
Companion: And you didn’t turn away from yours.
- But I didn’t fix myself.
	Companion: Healing isn’t a checklist.
	Companion: It’s showing up again and again.
- What if I mess something up?
	Companion: You will.
	Companion: And you’ll learn. Like everyone else.

Companion: You’ve seen what pain can do.
Companion: But you’ve also seen what understanding can do.
Companion: And that matters.
- So what happens now?
	Companion: There’s no “done.”
	Companion: Just steps.
	Companion: Just people.
	Companion: Just you, trying.
- Am I done?
	Companion: There’s no “done.”
	Companion: Just steps.
	Companion: Just people.
	Companion: Just you, trying.
- Was this enough?
	Companion: Enough isn’t a finish line.
	Companion: It’s what you carry forward.

Companion: Hey.
Companion: You have your own Chrysalis in you.
Companion: Keep going.
