Stranger2: There you are! We thought you dipped for good.
Stranger3: Yeah, we were actually worried. You okay?
Patrick2: [i]...They’re not mad?[/i]
Stranger1: Look, if talking in groups is scary, that’s totally fine. You’re not the only one.
Stranger2: Seriously, I used to panic just saying my name out loud.
Stranger3: And I still rehearse "hi" like five times in my head before saying it.
Patrick2: I thought... I thought you were all judging me.
Stranger1: Judging you? Nah, dude. We were just being dumb about spiders.
Stranger2: Yeah, we’re just glad you’re here. You don’t even have to talk if you don’t want to.
Patrick2: [i]Maybe... maybe I don’t have to be so afraid all the time.[/i]
Patrick2: ...But I will have to go to the shops now, they close soon.
Patrick2: Will you guys be here tomorrow?
Stranger1: Sure thing, meet you here!
