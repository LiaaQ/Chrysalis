Ella: You're right, I should have cleaned up ages ago...
Companion: What is stopping you?
Ella: I'm just so tired all the time.. So unmotivated, I don't feel like doing anything. Eating, sleeping, showering, it all feels like so much.
Companion: Whoosh, you seem really depressed. How long has this been going on?
Ella: I don't know, probably around a few weeks...
